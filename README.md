# RollABall-Game.

Roll-a-Ball is a simple 3D game created using Unity. The game allows players to control a rolling ball in a 3D environment. The goal of the game is to move the ball to collect all the scattered cubes in the scene, increasing the player's score with each cube collected. The game introduces basic Unity mechanics, such as object movement, collision detection, and score tracking.

The project was created as a tutorial to understand Unity's physics system and basic game development principles. Players control the ball using the keyboard and can navigate through the environment to gather all the collectible cubes.
